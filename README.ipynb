    "### What is resolution method\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution method is a rule that allows us to derive new logical conclusions by combining clauses that contain complementary literals (like A and ¬A). It uses proof by contradiction: we assume the opposite of what we want to prove, and if that leads to a contradiction, the original statement must be true.\n",
    "#### A Simple Example\n",
    "Let’s say we have a sentence:\n",
    "**“If it is sunny, I will go playing.”**\n",
    "Suppose today is sunny, and we want to check if it’s logically valid to conclude that **I will go playing**.  \n",
    "In logic, this whole situation can be represented like:\n",
    "(sunny → play) ∧ sunny ⊢ play\n",
    "*(If it is sunny, I will go playing. It is sunny. So, do I go playing?)*\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify this, we can use the resolution method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, convert everything into CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form):\n",
    "sunny → play ≡ ¬sunny ∨ play\n",
    "⊢ play ≡ ¬play (Want to prove play, so we assume ¬play)\n",
    "\n",
    "And how look our set of clauses:\n",
    "`[[¬sunny, play], [sunny], [¬play]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolution steps\n",
    "We take one clause for example `[¬sunny, play]` and another `[sunny]` and looking for contradiction, in our case this is `¬sunny` and `sunny` we eliminate them and create a new clause without them `[play]`. After this we repeat this step with another pair of clauses `[¬play]` and new one `[play]`, this two clauses creates an empty clause `[]` that mean that our sentence is true and I go playing"
